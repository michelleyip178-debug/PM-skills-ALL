# /decision — Decision Support

Read these files before generating output:
- `context/decisions-log.md` — all past scope, design, and prioritisation decisions
- `context/open-items.md` — unresolved items and open questions
- `context/risks.md` — active blockers and dependencies
- `projects/otep-mvp/sprint-checklists.md` — DoR blockers (often decision-gated)
- `projects/otep-mvp/scoping-gaps-tracker.md` — spec gaps and R1-deferred items
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — MVP guardrails and application flow logic
- Story files in `projects/otep-mvp/stories/` as needed for context

Ask me first: Are you making a decision, auditing past decisions, or checking after a decision was made?

**If making a decision — Pre-decision brief:**
Ask what the decision topic is, then read the relevant files and provide:
1. What we currently know about this topic from the local files
2. What options appear to have been considered (check decisions-log.md for superseded decisions)
3. What constraints should shape the decision (technical, policy, user needs — check risks.md and MVP guardrails)
4. What is still unknown that would affect the decision (check open-items.md)
5. A suggested framing: "we need to choose between X and Y because..."

**If auditing — Decision log review:**
Read decisions-log.md and cross-reference against open-items.md:
- List decisions that may need reconfirmation (context has changed)
- Flag decisions made informally that aren't in decisions-log.md (check story files for inline decisions)
- Identify assumptions being treated as facts — statements presented as given that haven't been validated

**If post-decision check:**
Ask what decision was just made, then check:
1. Does this decision conflict with anything in decisions-log.md or MVP guardrails?
2. What existing story files, sprint-checklists, or open items need updating as a result?
3. What downstream stories or features does this affect? (check story-id-map.md)
4. Does anything in risks.md suggest a risk we should flag?

Be specific and cite the source file for each finding.
