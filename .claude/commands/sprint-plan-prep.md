# Sprint Planning Prep

Prepare Michelle to lead sprint planning. Her job in this ceremony is to:
- Present a clear sprint goal
- Walk the team through the prioritised stories
- Let the team determine capacity — not dictate it

Read CLAUDE.md, context/current-sprint.md, and context/open-items.md
before generating output.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Draft the sprint goal
A good sprint goal is an outcome, not a task list.
Format: "By end of sprint, [user] can [do X], enabling [business outcome]"

Draft 2 versions — one conservative, one ambitious — so Michelle can
choose based on team capacity in the room.

### Step 2 — Identify the candidate stories
From the backlog, list stories that are:
- Grooming-ready (AC written, design in progress or done)
- Aligned to the sprint goal
- Free of unresolved blocking dependencies

Flag any story that has an unconfirmed OTG field — these are delivery risks.

### Step 3 — Flag capacity considerations
List known constraints for the upcoming sprint:
- Public holidays (check sprint dates)
- Team members with reduced availability
- Carry-over stories from current sprint (if any)

### Step 4 — Prepare Michelle's opening statement
Write a 3-4 sentence opening Michelle can use to start the sprint planning
session — covering the sprint goal, why it matters, and the top stories.

### Step 5 — Generate briefing
